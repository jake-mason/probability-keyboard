# Probability keyboard

An application of a [Variable-order Markov Chain Letter Prediction](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~mdw/CSOI/MarkovLab.html), this app displays a keyboard "heatmap" which shows the likeliest characters to follow a dynamic string entry. 

Running this allows you to enter a word, letter by letter, and see how the most likely next letter changes as more letters are added to the string. A keyboard heatmap with these probabilities pops up onscreen after each letter is added.
