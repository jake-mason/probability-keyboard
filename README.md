#probability_keyboard
This app shows the likeliest characters to follow a given string entry. 

Right now, running **procEntry**() allows you to enter a word, letter by letter, and see how the most likely next letter changes as more letters are added to the string.

Further functionality to display a keyboard and change the color of keys to indicate a letter's likelihood of occurring next is being developed.
