#probability_keyboard
This app shows the likeliest characters to follow a given string entry. 

For example, suppose the user wants to see how the frequencies of next letters change as they type a word, say "apple." Upon typing "a", a keyboard will appear, and different color shades will denote how likely a particular letter on the keyboard is to occur given "a". The user then types "p", bringing the string to "ap", and the program will then show the next likeliest letters, given "ap". This continues until the end of the word.
