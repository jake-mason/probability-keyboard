#probability_keyboard
This app displays a keyboard "heatmap" which shows the likeliest characters to follow a given string entry. 

Running **procEntryMap**() from the *simplified_script* module allows you to enter a word, letter by letter, and see how the most likely next letter changes as more letters are added to the string. A keyboard heatmap pops up on-screen after each letter is added, showing how likely a letter is to follow a string entry.
